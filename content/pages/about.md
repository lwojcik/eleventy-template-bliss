I'm Łukasz. Or just Luke. I'm a software engineer from Warsaw, Poland and I never know what to put in this section.

**{{ siteConfig.site.title }}** is my collection of personal writing. I'm reluctant to call it a blog but it ticks enough checkboxes to be labelled as one.

As a lifelong computer nerd I mix personal musings with various takes on technology, internet, media, society and how it all interplays with each other.

Since it's a personal website, I might intentionally neglect to draw clear lines between serious thoughts, subjective opinions and tasteless satire for the sake of cheap amusement. Bad news is that I assume you're capable of telling the difference between at least two of those. Good news is that whenever I switch to knowledge-sharing mode, I become serious and focused.
