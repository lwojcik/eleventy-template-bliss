# Bliss - Blog Theme For Eleventy

**Bliss** is a single-column blog template for [Eleventy static site generator](https://11ty.dev) with strong focus on simplicity without sacrificing functionality.

It is a modified and improved version of the theme running [Offbeat Bits - my personal blog](https://offbeatbits.com/).

## Features

- **light / dark mode switcher** + honoring browser color scheme preference
- **sharing buttons for popular social media** (including Mastodon!) + copying post URL to clipboard
- **Mastodon integration:** generating `.well-known/webfinger` file + automatic generation of `<link rel="me">` tags for site ownership verification
- **translation ready** (support for custom language tags + separate file with static phrases)
- **automatic favicon generation**
- **manifest file** for PWA
- **automatic OpenGraph image generation**
- **code syntax highlighting** with PrismJS using [Eleventy syntax highlighting plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/)
- **HTML, JS, JSON, CSS** optimizations
- **RSS, JSON, Twtxt.txt** feeds + JSON-LD data
- **accessibility** features
- **HSL color palette** and CSS variables for straightforward personalization
- modular CSS augmented with SASS
- custom disclaimers alongside post content
- and more

## Personalization checklist

Non-exhaustive list of steps to make the template **your own**. Some of them are optional, others are highly recommended:

- [ ] Fill in all relevant information in [`siteConfig.js`](./content/_data/siteConfig.js) - site title, description, custom logo, author information, etc.
- [ ] Modify production URL - either by hardcoding it in [`siteConfig.js`](./content/_data/siteConfig.js) or via `process.env.URL` environment variable
- [ ] Replace site logo or remove the existing one to use site title as text in your header
- [ ] Modify color palette to your liking - edit relevant variables in [`_variables.scss`](./src/styles/_variables.scss)
- [ ] If you changed the color palette - modify theme color and background color for PWA manifest - see [`siteConfig.js`](./content/_data/siteConfig.js)
- [ ] If you changed the color palette - modify base color for RSS XSL stylesheet - see [`siteConfig.js`](./content/_data/siteConfig.js)
- [ ] Enable automatic OpenGraph image generation - note that they only work for pages and posts
- [ ] Add your own posts - use the existing placeholder posts as a reference
- [ ] If you use post disclaimers at the beginning of your posts - consider using the built-in disclaimer feature - see [`06-10-sample-post-33-disclaimer.md`](./content/posts/2023/06-10-sample-post-33-disclaimer.md) or [`05-31-sample-post-32-linked-disclaimer.md`](./content/posts/2023/05-31-sample-post-32-linked-disclaimer.md) for reference
- [ ] Add your own pages - use one of the existing placeholder pages as a reference
- [ ] Add / remove meta pages in the footer - see [`siteConfig.js`](./content/_data/siteConfig.js)
- [ ] Replace a favicon file (`favicon.svg`) with your own - only one file is needed, the remaining ones will be generated on build
- [ ] Replace OpenGraph images with ones relevant to your site
- [ ] Decide if you want to use automated OpenGragh image generation + consider modifying their appearance to suit your taste (see `siteConfig.js` for more info)
- [ ] Copy your existing static assets to `assets` folder. Note that the top of `assets` folder corresponds to the _root directory_ of your site (`_site`)
- [ ] Modify anything else you don't like about the theme to match your preferences
- [ ] Enjoy! :)
